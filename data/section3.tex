\chapter{VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TITLE THAT FLOWS INTO A SECOND LINE FOR THE SAKE OF EXAMPLE}

Notice that the title of this section is long - much longer than the others. When you have long section titles, this template takes care of double spacing the lines in the title. If the title is long to fit in the table of contents, the template will single space the title.

\section{Yet Another Table}

Another table is placed here to show the effect of having tables in multiple sections. The list of tables should still double space between table titles, while single spacing long table titles.

%Fix table labeling.
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		\hline
		Dates & Attendance  \\ \hline
		August 8-10, 2008 & 3,523  \\ \hline
		August 14-16, 2009 & 4,003 \\ \hline
		July 9-11, 2010 & 5,049 \\ \hline
		August 5-7, 2011 & 6,891  \\ \hline
		August 10-12, 2012 & 9,464  \\ \hline
		August 16-18, 2013 & 11,077  \\ \hline
		July 18-20, 2014 & 14,686 \\ \hline
		July 31-August 2, 2015 & 18,411  \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{San Japan attendance. Data is taken from \cite{ANCONS}. I intentionally make the title of this table long so the single space effect is seen in the list of tables.}
\end{table}

You may be wondering why San Japan was chosen. There are a few reasons as to why I did this:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is one of the fastest-growing anime conventions in Texas.
\item Filler.
\item I wanted a good variety of table examples.
\item Because conventions are cool.
\end{enumerate}

The \textit{enumerate} environment was used to generated an ordered list above.

\section{Section Test Example}
We insert another figure here, just for kicks.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{LowPass_Filter_Design.png}
	\caption{A low pass filter design.}
\end{figure}
